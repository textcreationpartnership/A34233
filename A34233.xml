         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE mi≈øerable Cata≈øtrophies of the≈øe deplored Wretches, who≈øe ≈øad ends (though well de≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by rea≈øon of their Crimes) I here purpo≈øe to relate, the which may ≈øure amu≈øe the World, and rou≈øe ≈øecure Sinners from their drou≈øine≈øs, le≈øt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fate awake 'em, when too late, only to view their ≈øure and certain Death.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt in this Di≈øa≈øter was <hi>Robert Bareford,</hi> for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a Burglary upon a Hou≈øe in St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by the Name of the Seven Stars; and thence felloniou≈øly bearing away, contrary to the e≈øtabli≈øhed Laws of this Nation, and His Maje≈øties Crown and Dignity, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parcels, as well Hou≈øhold-goods as Money, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable value. Part of the Goods being found upon him he was committed: and in Court the Fellony and Burglary proved, he received Sentence, and on <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> being the 11th of this in≈øtant <hi>June,</hi> 1679 ≈øuffered accordingly at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn.</hi> His penitence, as to outward appearance, ≈øeemed more than commonly from ≈øuch Offenders can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</p>
            <p>The next of whom we ≈øhall treat, that by his evil cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30932:3"/> brought him≈øelf to this untimely and di≈øgraceful end, was <hi>Richard Capel;</hi> a young Man, but an old Offender; having been once burnt in the Hand at <hi>Surry</hi> A≈ø≈øizes: And in the late Conflagration of <hi>New Pri≈øon,</hi> he then being Pri≈øoner there, e≈øcaped thence in the Hurry and Throng of People a≈ø≈øembled at that time for the extingui≈øhing of the Fire: of which Fire I ≈øuppo≈øe few are ignorant. He not being content with his liberty, fell to his old Employment afre≈øh; for, as our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Proverb more fully denotes, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible 'tis to wi≈øh an</hi> Ethiopian <hi>white,</hi> ≈øo accu≈øtomed Crimes do ≈øeldome leave indulged Sinners; for the≈øe often warnings were not ≈øufficient to prevail upon his ≈øerious thoughts, but following ≈øtill tho≈øe fatal Tracks that tend to Death and Hell, at la≈øt he was En≈ønared in his Devices: For one Evening, ≈øomewhat late, he did commit a Fellony in a Cooks Hou≈øe in <hi>Blackamore-≈øtreet,</hi> bearing thence as much Pewter as he could conveniently carry; being met and ≈øtopped by the Watch, he told them he had it in ≈øuch a place, but the people being called up would not own it; but after ≈øome time they, by the Marks, found the right Owner; whereupon he was committed, and after ≈øenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and this day executed. His Behaviour in Pri≈øon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his condemnation was more than ordinarily pennitent, confe≈ø≈øing and bewailing his former lude and vicious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes; for it is commonly ≈øeen that Death's unavoidable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach often ≈øtartles the harde≈øt Sinner. At the place of Execution he de≈øired all to take warning by his untimely end, and that they timely would repent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Benjamin Dauforn</hi> was the next; for that Artificial Trade of Pocket-picking; and 'tis the more remarkable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon he dur≈øt venture upon that unlawful Art in the Grand

He likewi≈øe at the place of Execution, when he ≈øaw all hopes of pardon vain, and that Death's fatal A≈øpects were ≈øo dreadful, ≈øhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of tears for his former ≈øins, and begged eternal mercy for his Soul.</p>
            <p>The next, in order, was <hi>Henry Sea≈øon,</hi> for robbing a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of Quality in <hi>Che≈øwick,</hi> and felloniou≈øly bearing away a Flitch of Bacon, two Kettles, and other things, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been an old Effender heretofore, was ≈øentenced, and accordingly executed. He much bewailed his Offences during his being in the Hold, and ≈øaid, That bad Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had enticed him to act that, and many other Exploits; but that he hoped for mercy from above, although he could expect none here below, by rea≈øon of the hainou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of his former Offenees; and he was exceeding peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the la≈øt, de≈øiring the Spectators to ≈øupplicate Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence for mercy on his Soul, when he ≈øhould appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Dread Tribunal, to an≈øwer for his wilful and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs Sin, and former Offences.</p>
            <p>There were ≈øeaven more Condemned to Die, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a mo≈øt gracious Reprieve, in expectation of their Amendment for the future.</p>
